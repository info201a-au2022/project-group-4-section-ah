|Abstract | Our main question is how various factors affect the duration and quality of sleep in younger generations. This question is important because quality sleep is vital to the physical and cognitive development of young children, and studying if, how, and why that sleep is affected is key to understanding the health of younger generations. To address this question, we will examine and analyze data that correlates various factors such as screen time, mental health, and stress management to sleep, and examine if there is a link between any of these factors and sleep. |
|Keywords | 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.  (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data") |
|Introduction | Our lives can be summed up into two parts, awake and asleep. Sleep is an essential part of our lives. We can’t avoid sleeping, it is our basic human nature to sleep. Not only does it physically and mentally recharge us for the day ahead but many phycological events occur in the brain that the human body needs. Collectively, society functions less without sleep. Sleep is a natural and primal part of every living organism. As a result, the data on sleep is vast and well diverse. It is known that people of the new generations aren’t getting enough sleep, but why? There are many assumed reasons why people aren’t getting enough sleep so this data will show the correlations between sleep and these reasons. From this data, conclusions can be made whether these reasons should kept or monitored in a person’s life. |
|Problem Domain - Kai| Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (About 400 words.) |
|Research Questions | **(1) What factors, if any, affect the duration and quality of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a broad question that seeks to identify what factors may affect sleep, or if there is no correlation between factors and sleep quality. The question is a good starting point to identify if more specific research should be pursued. <br><br> **(2) Does increased screen time lead to lower quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?**<br> This is a specific question that examines if the advent of the Internet and accessibility of mobile devices has led younger generations to have a lower quality sleep. While this question is specific, it also helps partially answer the broader question regarding what factors affect the quality of sleep. <br><br> **(3) Is there a correlation between stress management and quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a specific question that examines if another specific factor, stress management, has any correlation with sleep patterns. It also helps to partially answer the broader question regarding what factors affect the quality of sleep, but stress management is not necessarily unique to younger generations like the Internet and mobile devices are. <br><br> **(4) Is there a correlation between mental health and quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a specific question that examines if mental health has any correlation with sleep patterns. Once again, this helps answer the broader question, but mental health is something that while not unique to younger generations, has been seen more recently as a problem for younger generations and thus is important to examine in relation to sleep patterns. |
|The Dataset | **(1)** Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions.
