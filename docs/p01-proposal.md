|Abstract | Our main question is how various factors affect the duration and quality of sleep in younger generations. This question is important because quality sleep is vital to the physical and cognitive development of young children, and studying if, how, and why that sleep is affected is key to understanding the health of younger generations. To address this question, we will examine and analyze data that correlates various factors such as screen time, mental health, and stress management to sleep, and examine if there is a link between any of these factors and sleep. |

|Introduction | Our lives can be summed up into two parts, awake and asleep. Sleep is an essential part of our lives. We can’t avoid sleeping, it is our basic human nature to sleep. Not only does it physically and mentally recharge us for the day ahead but many phycological events occur in the brain that the human body needs. Collectively, society functions less without sleep. Sleep is a natural and primal part of every living organism. As a result, the data on sleep is vast and well diverse. It is known that people of the new generations aren’t getting enough sleep, but why? There are many assumed reasons why people aren’t getting enough sleep so this data will show the correlations between sleep and these reasons. From this data, conclusions can be made whether these reasons should kept or monitored in a person’s life. |
|Problem Domain | **Background** <br> The most influential time in a person’s life is when they are young and their brain is still developing. Childhood can greatly determine and affect one’s futures, so establishing good habits will prepared them for success. (Source: https://www.cde.ca.gov/SP/CD/re/caqdevelopment.asp) <br><br>
**Direct stake holders:** <br> The direct stakeholders are generally everyone, most it mostly applies to those who need it, such as people who receive inadequate sleep. These people are, but not limited to, people with poor sleeping habits, parents of restless children, people in employment, and students. The importance of sleep is greatly emphasized toward these groups due to them requiring it the most. In 2020, a study was conducted and it was found that roughly 35% of Adults don’t get enough sleep and 78% of high schoolers in 2019. (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html) <br><br> **Indirect stake holders:** <br>
The indirect stakeholders are the people who depend of the restless to get rest, such as schools, work, and the people around them. People with inadequate sleep tend to function slower and inefficently. Reaction time drops, impairment to judgment, and can lead to forgetfulness which can cause someone to become a liability when driving or dealing with potentially hazardous equipement. Schools need their students well rested in order to attend school on time and learn. 
**Human values:** <br>This data’s purpose is to educate people about healthy sleeping habits to encourage a healthy well-being. This data offeres truth and knowledge about sleep and what effects it. <br><br> **Benefits:** <br> A large portion of the young community, mostly those enrolled in high school to college, suffer from improper sleep which can lead to a less productive ability to learn. All of which, can lead up to built up stress and procrastination and result in more inadequate sleep. People in the work force who suffer from sleep deprivation can be a liability to those around them, so providing this information to both communities with increase the productivity of the human race as a whole.

Some of these data sets cover important things that we value in out lives that some may have to sacrifice in order to obtain the desired amount of sleep. Parents will take note of the reasons that interfere with their children’s sleep schedule and remove it.|
|Research Questions | **(1) What factors, if any, affect the duration and quality of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a broad question that seeks to identify what factors may affect sleep, or if there is no correlation between factors and sleep quality. The question is a good starting point to identify if more specific research should be pursued. <br><br> **(2) Does increased screen time lead to lower quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?**<br> This is a specific question that examines if the advent of the Internet and accessibility of mobile devices has led younger generations to have a lower quality sleep. While this question is specific, it also helps partially answer the broader question regarding what factors affect the quality of sleep. <br><br> **(3) Is there a correlation between stress management and quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a specific question that examines if another specific factor, stress management, has any correlation with sleep patterns. It also helps to partially answer the broader question regarding what factors affect the quality of sleep, but stress management is not necessarily unique to younger generations like the Internet and mobile devices are. <br><br> **(4) Is there a correlation between mental health and quality and duration of sleep in younger generations?** <br> This is a specific question that examines if mental health has any correlation with sleep patterns. Once again, this helps answer the broader question, but mental health is something that while not unique to younger generations, has been seen more recently as a problem for younger generations and thus is important to examine in relation to sleep patterns. |
